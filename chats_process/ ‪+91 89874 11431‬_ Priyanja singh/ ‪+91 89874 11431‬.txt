: A conversation between Wayne Dyer and his student:
“If I were to squeeze this orange as hard as I could, what would come out?” I asked him.
He looked at me like I was a little crazy and said, “Juice, of course”.

“Do you think apple juice could come out of it?”
‘No! he laughed.

‘What about grapefruit juice?’
‘No!’

‘What would come of it?’
‘Orange juice, of course’

‘Why? Why when you squeeze an orange does orange juice comes out?’

He may have been getting a little exasperated with me at this point.

“Well, it’s an orange and that’s what’s inside.”
I nodded.

“Let’s assume that this orange isn’t an orange, but it’s you. And someone squeezes you, puts pressure on you, says something you don’t like, offends you. And out of you comes anger, hatred, bitterness, fear. Why?

The answer, as our young friend has told us, is “because that’s what’s inside”. It’s one of the great lessons of life.

What come out when life squeezes you? When someone hurts or offends you? If anger, pain and fear come out of you, it’s because that’s what’s inside. It doesn’t matter who does the squeezing: your mother, your brother, your children, the government.

If someone says something about you that you don’t like, what comes out of you is what’s inside. And what’s inside is up to you, it’s your choice.

When someone puts the pressure on you and out of you comes anything other than love, it’s because that’s what you’ve allowed to be inside. Once you take away all those negative things you don’t want in your life and replace them with love, you’ll find yourself living a highly functioning life.”

Squeeze out Love and Compassion!!!

: ✨Excellent interpretation of Ramayan !!

Ram is your soul. Sita is your heart. Ravan is your mind that steals your heart from your soul. Lakshman is your consciousness, always with you and active on your behalf. Hanuman is your intuition and courage that helps retrieve your heart to re-animate your soul🍃
Happy Dussehra 💥
